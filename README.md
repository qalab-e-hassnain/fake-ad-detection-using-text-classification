## Project Description

Fake advertisements can deceive users and lead to various issues such as financial loss and safety concerns. The goal of this project is to create a solution that can automatically identify and flag potentially fake ads, helping users make informed decisions when browsing listings on PakWheels.

The project consists of the following components:

- **Data Collection**: Scraping ads from the PakWheels website to create a dataset for training and testing machine learning models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify ads as genuine or fake.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Integration**: Integrating the trained model into a web application or API for real-time ad classification.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains raw, processed, and labeled datasets.
- **src/**: Source code for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and other functionalities.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
- **models/**: Trained machine learning models saved in serialized format.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including README, project overview, and usage instructions.

## Setup and Usage

To set up the project environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the necessary scripts or notebooks for data collection, preprocessing, and model training.
4. Evaluate model performance using the provided evaluation metrics.
5. Integrate the trained model into your application or use it for ad classification.

For detailed setup instructions and usage examples, refer to the documentation provided in the `docs/` directory.
